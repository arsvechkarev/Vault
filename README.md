#### Or download apk directly from [the latest release](https://github.com/arsvechkarev/Vault/releases/latest).

Vault is a password manager that helps you keep your passwords and other sensitive data organized. It is based on **kdbx** format that is used by [KeePass](https://keepass.info/), which means that it is compatible with every KeePass-based password manager. It is fast, secure and has an intuitive UX â€“ everything you need from a reliable password manager.

> [!NOTE]
> Vault uses internet permission to download icons for passwords (you can find them [here](https://github.com/arsvechkarev/Vault/tree/master/icons/files)), but **no sensitive data like your master password or secret file is ever sent anywhere**. If you find this feature undesirable, you can disable it in app settings.
